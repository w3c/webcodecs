Registration Entry Requirements {#registration-entry-requirements}
==================================================================

A registration entry is a document describing one or several metadata entries,
and has the following requirements:
1. Each metadata entry is defined as a separate {{VideoFrameMetadata}}
    dictionary member.
2. Each metadata entry must be serializable.
3. Each metadata entry must be defined by a W3C specification that has
    reached consensus in the originating Working Group.
4. The specification defining each metadata entry must provide clearly defined
    semantics. In particular, interactions with the media processing pipeline
    (encoders, decoders, renderers, etc.) should be well defined.
5. A candidate registration entry must be announced by filing an issue in the
    WebCodecs GitHub issue tracker so they can be discussed and evaluated for
    compliance before being added to the registry. If the Media Working Group
    reaches consensus to accept the candidate, a pull request should be drafted
    (either by editors or by the party requesting the candidate registration)
    to register the candidate. The registry editors will review and merge the
    pull request.
6. Existing entries may be changed after being published, through the same
    process as candidate entries. Possible changes include modification of
    the link to the public specification.
7. Existing entries may be deprecated. This requires Media Working Group
    consensus, and if still active, consensus of the Working Group that
    originated the registration entry specification.
